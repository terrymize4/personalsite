  <h3>About me:</h3>
  <p>
    I am Thomas Abraham from Tamilnadu, India. I am from a family of eight. I finished by high school last year and now I am doing computer science engineering in an university where they mostly teach trash for first couple of years although not everything they teach is trash but still most of them are. So, I am just trying to get good at something or a skill which I'd need in the end, after finishing the college to get a job regardless of whatever the trash I was taught in there.

  <h3>Something about god:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      He's the only person who cares. The only person who'd care no matter what of a bad / evil thing you did in the past, his love pulls you off your previous sinful life and saves your from eternal damnation. He'll give you a new life where everything happens as you like, you'll be tested by Satan when you're weak but he'll save you for you'll always have faith in him.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always love him and pray to him and he shall respond to you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always seek him when you're not in danger and in danger.
    </li>
  </ul>
